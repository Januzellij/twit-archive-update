twit-archive-update is a script to auto-update local Twitter archives with your newest tweets. Just `go get` the package, and run with your archive path as the first argument ("~"'s will automatically be replaced with your home directory).

## Todo:
Cut down on the size of the JSON files
Fix t.co links, to make them actually be clickable
Update user_details.js with any new user details
This may be the hackiest script I've ever written, so code cleanup would be a nice improvement.

### Warning: This script has no tests, not enough error checking, and some known and unknown bugs. Please make a backup copy of your archive in case things go haywire.
